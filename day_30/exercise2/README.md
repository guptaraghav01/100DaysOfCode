## KeyError Handling

# Issue

We've got some buggy code, try running the code. The code will crash and give you a **KeyError**. This is because some of the posts in the `facebook_posts` don't have any `"Likes"`.


# Bad Output

# Instructions

Use what you've learnt about exception handling to **prevent** the program from crashing. 


# Hint

1. You'll need to catch the KeyError exception. 

2. Posts without any likes can be counted as 0 likes.
