## List Comprehension 1

# Instructions

You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called `squared_numbers`. This new list should contain every number in the list `numbers` but each number should be squared.

```
e.g. `4 * 4 = 16`
```

```
4 squared equals 16.
```

**DO NOT** modify the List `numbers` directly. Try to use **List Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

# Example Output

```
[1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]
```

# Hint

1. Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.

2. Make sure the squared_numbers is printed into the console for the code checking to work.
